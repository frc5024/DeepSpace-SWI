Automatic camera streaming\&. 

Because I am too lazy to type this stuff out manually every time I start a new project\&. 
.PP
This should be re-implemented with h\&.264 streaming before 2020\&.\&.\&. \fIFIRST\fP needs some better networking gear\&. I have a gigabit link internally in the robot, and our shop also happens to have\&.\&. Guess what? A gigabit wifi link! Come on guys\&.\&. It's 2019\&. Give me something more than 'Maybe 4mb/s'\&. 
.PP
For now, we are stuck with the mess that is MJPG\&.\&. Or offload video encoding, which would be a great idea if people would actually respect the hardware (I'm talking to you, whoever hot glued my raspberry PI to a piece of cardboard, then zip-tied it to some lexan)\&. I understand that nobody could find a case for it, but 1\&. there where 6 weeks to buy one, and 2\&. you have seen me drive a robot right? If all 6 wheels are touching the ground or it isn't drifting, it's not me\&. 
.PP
If you actually took the time to read this, I think you either need a break, or you should go find yourself a task to work on\&.
